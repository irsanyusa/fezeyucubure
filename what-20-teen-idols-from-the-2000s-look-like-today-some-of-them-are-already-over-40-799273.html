<time>09 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>We&nbsp;saw them star in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV series, launch a&nbsp;new album, give group or&nbsp;solo concerts, fall in&nbsp;love, split&nbsp;up, break&nbsp;up, and then find love again... And suddenly, without&nbsp;us even noticing anything, they all turned 40&nbsp;years old! Yep, our favorite teen stars from the 00s have grown up&nbsp;and are now very, very different from what we&nbsp;remember seeing 2&nbsp;decades ago on&nbsp;small screens that weren’t flat yet!</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;one-way ticket to&nbsp;the past on&nbsp;the Nostalgia Express by&nbsp;comparing how our teen idols look today and how they looked back when thinking of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;device with a&nbsp;touchscreen meant that you were reading too many sci-fi stories. Some of&nbsp;them have changed so&nbsp;much, you won’t even be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;recognize them!</p><p><h2>1. The Backstreet Boys</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/431/a15/0540a75b7798a923bb4214e6df.jpg><p>Although the concept of&nbsp;a&nbsp;“boy band” seems a&nbsp;bit obsolete today, for the <a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a> that has never been a&nbsp;problem. After becoming one of&nbsp;the most famous pop bands in&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;the ’90s and early 2000s, they took a&nbsp;break from 2003 to&nbsp;2006. Then, they came back and even managed to&nbsp;win over a&nbsp;new generation’s heart. Today, Kevin (48&nbsp;years old), Brian (45&nbsp;years old), Nick (40&nbsp;years old), Howie (47&nbsp;years old), and A.J. (42&nbsp;years old) are still active, giving concerts and touring around the world. In&nbsp;total, they’ve been active for about 27&nbsp;years... Not too bad, right?</p><p><h2>2. JC&nbsp;Chasez</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa4/0c0/35c4155f708d0a65d2bf5d45c0.jpg><p>Singer, dancer, composer, producer, and actor <a href=#>JC&nbsp;Chasez</a> has conquered more than one teenage heart since he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the band <a href=#>NSYNC</a>. Oh, how many times we&nbsp;wondered who was really leading the band, him or&nbsp;Justin! But thanks to&nbsp;Chasez’s charisma, he&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;became that element that held the whole band together in&nbsp;perfect harmony. Chasez is&nbsp;now 44&nbsp;years old and, although he&nbsp;gave up&nbsp;his solo career, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;the music business composing songs for other artists.</p><p><h2>3. Spice Girls</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c57/fff/e1e7375d71b70bc5555d5f92e4.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Spice Girls</a> were a&nbsp;completely new and revolutionary phenomenon for pop music back in&nbsp;the 1990s and early 2000s. Each of&nbsp;the girl’s personalities (Geri, Melanie C, Victoria, Melanie&nbsp;B, and Emma) attracted a&nbsp;different type of&nbsp;crowd of&nbsp;young people in&nbsp;their time. After experiencing some difficulties between members, the group disbanded in&nbsp;2001. However, in&nbsp;2007 they returned to&nbsp;the stage after successfully bonding again and repairing the relationship between the 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;them. Today, all of&nbsp;them have celebrated their 40th birthday, but they continue to&nbsp;give concerts. That&nbsp;is, of&nbsp;course, except for Victoria, who is&nbsp;now more dedicated to&nbsp;her public image as&nbsp;a&nbsp;soloist.</p><p><h2>4. Rachel McAdams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf8/1d2/b62c8c551d8745daedf1435d1c.jpg><p>What kind of&nbsp;list would this be&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;didn’t add the beautiful and charismatic “Queen Bee” <a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a>. She was launched to&nbsp;fame after playing Regina George in&nbsp;the modern classic rom-com Mean Girls. Her obnoxious but equally adorable character is&nbsp;remembered for making Lindsay Lohan’s life miserable. Her great performance didn’t leave anyone indifferent and she soon became a&nbsp;youthful idol. However, the actress proved that she was not only a&nbsp;talented rom-com actress. She has since played other roles that are demanding and interesting as&nbsp;well. Thanks to&nbsp;her skills and dedication she has already received, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41, several nominations for important <a href=# title=awards data-link=tag>awards</a> like an&nbsp;Oscar, a&nbsp;BAFTA, and a&nbsp;SAG.</p><p><h2>5. Leonardo DiCaprio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f0/3e9/73d2a15537a41b9fa7a75264ed.jpg><p>The popular and amazing <a href=#>“Leo” DiCaprio</a> became every teenage girl’s dream boy from the 2000s, after his stunning performance as&nbsp;Jack Dawson in&nbsp;Titanic. But that wasn’t enough for him. Time and again he&nbsp;has gone out of&nbsp;his comfort zone, which is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;became one of&nbsp;the best actors of&nbsp;our time. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;45, he’s still rocking the set and delivering one great performance after the other. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also known for his engagement in&nbsp;the fight against <a href=# title="climate change" data-link=tag>climate change</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b1b/c60/f3a59651bea83c39d93c5f2a7f.jpg><p><a href=#>Freddie Prinze, Jr.</a> and <a href=#>Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> met in&nbsp;the 1990s on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the movie I&nbsp;Know What You Did Last Summer... and the rest is&nbsp;history. In&nbsp;the early 2000s, they appeared in&nbsp;virtually all of&nbsp;the magazines covering the lives of&nbsp;celebrities. They were the example of&nbsp;the perfect relationship, which finally led them to&nbsp;walk down the aisle in&nbsp;2002. Since they met and fell in&nbsp;love, they have been one of&nbsp;the most solid couples in&nbsp;Hollywood’s history. And even if&nbsp;roughly 20&nbsp;years have passed and Freddie is&nbsp;44&nbsp;and Sarah Michelle&nbsp;43, they are still the perfect example of&nbsp;how happy endings don’t just happen in&nbsp;the movies. They are both parents now and lead a&nbsp;happy life.</p><p><h2>7. Nick Lachey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8a/a4c/9ac60955b3b23d924a63c10237.jpg><p><a href=#>Nick Lachey</a> is&nbsp;known for having been a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;another of&nbsp;those vibrant and short-lived boy bands that were so&nbsp;typical of&nbsp;the 90s. His was called <a href=#>98&nbsp;Degrees</a> and it&nbsp;has split up&nbsp;and reunited several times since it&nbsp;was first created in&nbsp;1995. But that isn’t Lachey’s sole source of&nbsp;fame. For a&nbsp;while, he&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;many magazine covers because he&nbsp;was dating pop singer Jessica Simpson, whom he&nbsp;eventually married. Too bad their “dream” marriage only lasted for 4&nbsp;years. At&nbsp;46, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still active on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, but in&nbsp;the last 3&nbsp;years or&nbsp;so&nbsp;we&nbsp;haven’t really seen him anywhere near showbiz.</p><p><h2>8. Tia and Tamera</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c1/027/0c3b6c50429be9bd345584c370.jpg><p>The famous Nickelodeon twins of&nbsp;the ’90s, <a href=#>Tia</a> and <a href=#>Tamera</a> Mowry, are now 42&nbsp;years old. And even if&nbsp;they were both amazingly skilled actresses, Tia is&nbsp;the only one that is&nbsp;still active in&nbsp;television series and movies. But the great thing is&nbsp;that they are still very close. Also, notice how they look just as&nbsp;young as&nbsp;when we&nbsp;first saw them on&nbsp;TV!</p><p><h2>9. Mark Hoppus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22a/164/73c83f557fba1443f7a2339d63.jpg><p>The bass guitarist and co-vocalist of&nbsp;Blink-182 known for his rebellious attitude, <a href=#>Mark Hoppus</a>, is&nbsp;now 48&nbsp;years old. And while he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still involved in&nbsp;many projects related to&nbsp;the music industry, mainly writing and producing songs for other artists, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;complete makeover and left behind his rebel-without-a-cause teenage look.</p><p><h2>10. Rider Strong</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/618/f58/bbc2bf59a38dfee95d31efeaca.jpg><p>Boy Meets World co-star, <a href=#>Rider Strong</a>, is&nbsp;already in&nbsp;his 40s. Strong has appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few television series in&nbsp;recent years and, of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;also played a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the episodes of&nbsp;the spin-off of&nbsp;the series that made him famous, Girl Meets World, that aired in&nbsp;2004.</p><p><h2>11. Melissa Joan Hart</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/37b/9e2/62718c552181fa536ff7c5c086.jpg><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;talk about the real teenage icons of&nbsp;the late 1990s and early 2000s, there’s no&nbsp;way we&nbsp;can leave out <a href=#>Melissa Joan Hart</a>. She first became famous for playing Clarissa, but she really hit the jackpot when she brought Sabrina, the teenage witch of&nbsp;Archie’s world, to&nbsp;the small screens of&nbsp;teenagers all over the world. And although it&nbsp;seemed that Melissa would remain a&nbsp;teenager for the rest of&nbsp;her life, the truth is&nbsp;that she has turned 44. She is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;mother now and, while she’s decided to&nbsp;dedicate her life to&nbsp;acting, she also shares her day-to-day life on&nbsp;social media.</p><p><h2>12. Joshua Jackson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb4/b40/649e7751f9b47ef16be0b0c95e.jpg><p>Famous for bringing Pacey Witter’s character to&nbsp;the small screen in&nbsp;Warner Brothers’ Dawson’s Creek, <a href=#>Joshua Jackson</a> managed to&nbsp;get everything a&nbsp;celebrity could have wished to&nbsp;have in&nbsp;the 2000s. Now, at&nbsp;42, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the star of&nbsp;the miniseries Little Fires Everywhere.</p><p><h2>13. Ryan Phillippe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/078/f1e/d471535ca8a094549ec344c465.jpg><p>More than one teenage girl fell for the iconic bad boy of&nbsp;Hollywood, <a href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a>. And it’s kind of&nbsp;funny because he&nbsp;wasn’t particularly rebellious outside of&nbsp;the sets, that&nbsp;is. Clearly, his character in&nbsp;the film Cruel Intentions was far from being the guy you’d want to&nbsp;introduce to&nbsp;your parents. And even if&nbsp;you wouldn’t believe&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now 46&nbsp;years old and already the father of&nbsp;2&nbsp;children. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;still acting but hasn’t announced any new projects in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while.</p><p><h2>14. Eminem</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/597/46f/00aa3d5c4e956c5f660b86f4eb.jpg><p>The controversial <a href=#>rapper</a> who gave&nbsp;us plenty to&nbsp;talk about in&nbsp;the early 2000s is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;turn 48. Yep, that’s almost 50! And although his songs are no&nbsp;longer known for their sharp criticism of&nbsp;the music industry, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;respected figure in&nbsp;the music of&nbsp;his genre. Today his projects are of&nbsp;course much more mature and developed. Still, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;hard for millennials to&nbsp;forget Eminem’s rebellious yet sensitive image that granted him immense success.</p><p><h2>15. Ashton Kutcher</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9be/a99/798a6b57bba54f93371c99c1ab.jpg><p>At&nbsp;42&nbsp;years old, <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer the scatterbrained Kelso we&nbsp;saw on&nbsp;That ’70s Show or&nbsp;the prankster who hosted MTV’s Punk’d. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;now married to&nbsp;Mila Kunis, with whom he&nbsp;has 2&nbsp;children. His life has changed quite a&nbsp;bit since those crazy years after he&nbsp;dated actress Demi Moore. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;now focused on&nbsp;other more mature projects, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;some altruistic and socially responsible campaigns.</p><p><h2>16. Jared Leto</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/290/efb/c73388551d993db02876bd39a2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the early 2000s, <a href=#>Jared Leto</a>’s name was in&nbsp;everyone’s mouth, either because they were talking about the movies he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;or&nbsp;because they listened to&nbsp;the music he&nbsp;composed. As&nbsp;the lead singer of&nbsp;the alternative punk-rock band 30&nbsp;Seconds to&nbsp;Mars, Jared’s style has changed several times over these years. Now, at&nbsp;48, he&nbsp;remains a&nbsp;renowned actor and musician, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;committed philanthropist.</p><p>How does it&nbsp;feel to&nbsp;see your teen idols turn 40&nbsp;and have kids and an&nbsp;adult life? Do&nbsp;you think they’ve changed a&nbsp;lot over the years?
