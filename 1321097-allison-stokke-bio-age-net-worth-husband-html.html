Her interest in pole vaulting grew when she joined Newport Harbor High School.</p><p class=align-left>She joined the pole vaulting group in her school. She quickly rose to become a nation-wide sensation, especially after winning 2004’s 15/16 United States title at the age of 15 years.</p><p class=align-left>She has been known to break and set new records throughout her young career. Even so, her great success did not come easy.</p><p class=align-left>She broke her legs twice after missing landings.<a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener"> One of the injuries </a>happened in 2005 during a practice session. She was trying out a new pole she had never used before when disaster struck when she failed to get a high enough vault to get her to the landing pad.</p><h4><strong>How did Allison break the internet?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Most people hardly know the names of athletes unless they are interested in the sport and the personalities involved. However, Stokke's case was different when she became a sensation online after her picture in the field was sexualized.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d3321ee7ba20efeb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anna Beth Goodman bio: Age, family, career, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It happened that a journalist in New York took Allison's pic back in 2007. The picture was meant for a Californian track and field website which was not a problem.</p><p class=align-left>However, things go out of hand when the pic, which was taken earlier in the year 2007, was later re-posted on a sports blog site, With Leather, months later. The blog is known to have a huge male fan-base whose comments on pics are not always polite.</p><p class=align-left>The blogger wrote an article titled 'Pole Vaulting is Sexy, Barely Legal,' thus attracting comments from his fans. As usual, the fans went on to ravel about Allison's sexiness, not minding that she was only 17 years old when the picture was taken.</p><p class=align-left>In fact, she had just turned 18 when the blogger shared it, thus portraying her as a sex symbol. The blogger's descriptions focused on Stokke's physical appearance rather than on her skills as an athlete.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c876d96bce6adc0a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Galina Becker's biography: what is known about Roman Reigns’ wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unsurprisingly, though, the blog was known to objectify women in sports. It was not a shock that the picture went viral after the blog owner shared it with his readers, adding his own suggestive comments and descriptions to the posted pic.</p><p class=align-left>The photographer threatened to take Matt Ufford, the owner of the blog, to court if he failed to take the picture down. However, the damage was already done, and Allison Stokke infamous photo was already doing rounds online.</p><p class=align-left>Many more websites had picked it up and posted it on their sites. Allison Stokke hot pics had gained a lot of attention, to the point where she was mentioned on national publications including The Washington Post, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and on numerous online search engines.</p><p class=align-left>She even got mentioned internationally by the Australian site, The Sydney Morning Herald, in addition to attracting the attention of German's daily Der Spiegel.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e4a8b58092a183f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sofia Bevarly biography: age, height, measurements, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While most of what happened was not intentional, this specific Allison Stokke famous picture got her trending online for a while.

Nevertheless, she did not let this put her down.</p><p class=align-left>A photo that had been innocently taken when she was on the field had been turned into a sexual symbol against her will. All of a sudden, she became the example of what could go wrong when a girl competed in athletics.</p><p class=align-left>New websites and social media fan pages were created, all of which focused on circulating her pics. Sadly, the attention was not drawn to her achievements, but rather focused on how sexy she was.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8aece6f9e61ebc48.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sabrina Lynn biography: age, measurements, net worth, career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While she continually gained unnecessary attention both on social and mainstream media, she kept her head high. She did not let the emails and countless friend requests she got, some of which came from grown men, dissuade her from working on a possible future career in pole vaulting.</p><h4><strong>Dad comes in to help</strong></h4><p class=align-left>As a trained lawyer, Allison's dad, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Allan Stokke</a>, tried to help his daughter get ahead of the scandal that had already gotten out of hand. He combed through all the sexist comments being said about his daughter, trying to find out if there was a stalker, or if anyone had said anything illegal.</p><p class=align-left>This was his own simple way of trying to ensure that no harm came to his daughter. However, he was well-aware of the fact that they would not be able to stop the internet.</p><h4><strong>A ray of hope</strong></h4><p class=align-left>When everything seemed overwhelming and impossible to solve, CBS came in to offer a little hope for the family. It managed to turn the story around into an educative one, warning viewers about how easy it was to turn young people into public figures all for the wrong reasons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d550596cbac9675a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charissa Thompson biography: Age, husband, net worth, salary</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The televised show was aimed at highlighting the plight of the people who were affected by such negative publicity such as Allison.</p><h4><strong>Career salvaged</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8524e34bbc497fc5.jpg><p class=align-left>Not many people would have survived the pressure that came with the massive attention that Allison had to bear when her photos went completely viral. All attempts that she and her family made to keep strangers from invading her privacy only made them even more adamant as they became even more invasive.</p><p class=align-left>She focused on getting through high school and getting a chance to move on. Not giving up on her dreams, Allison emerged eighth at the national junior championships in her final year of high school.</p><p class=align-left>The results were pretty impressive and meant that she still had a shot at doing what she enjoyed most. However, it appeared as though she would have to wait to get offers to join a higher institution of learning of her choice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f88960536c3eb1c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beth Leonard biography: what is known about Darius Rucker's wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her decision to attend the University of California, Berkeley came after a long wait. She was awarded an athletic scholarship to compete as a pole vaulter for their track and field program.</p><p class=align-left>What is more, she would be working with one of the most reputable trainers, coach Scott Slover, a previous five-time All-American at UCLA.</p><p class=align-left>She trained hard to gain success in her college pole vaulting career. Allison registered early success in her first year at UC Berkeley when she broke the school’s freshman record with a vault of 4.11 meters (13 feet, 5 ¾ inches).</p><p class=align-left>One year later, she came eighth at the Pac-10 Championships in addition to emerging seventh at the MPSF Indoor Championships. Her continued success made her debut at the NCAA Women’s Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships, where she completed in the 19th position.</p><p class=align-left>By the time she was a sophomore, it had appeared as though her pole vaulting career was receding. Despite adding 4 inches to her personal best pole, she emerged eighth at the Pac-10 Championships and seventh at the MPSF Indoor Championships, failing to appear among the top.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/defb8b338c58e241.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Megan Thee Stallion's bio: Age, height, net worth, boyfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her junior year saw her falter even more when she failed to make it for the NCAA Championships qualifications.</p><h4><strong>Trying for the 2012 Olympics</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Despite her diminishing collegiate performance, she chose to concentrate on competing in the London Olympics. Her efforts began to pay off when in 2012, she registered a new lifetime best of 4.36 meters (14 feet, 3 ½ inches).</p><p class=align-left>This was the redeeming chance proving that Stokke still had a strong chance to make it to the Olympics. All she had to do was to clear the height that mattered most.</p><p class=align-left>She continued to put in work to increase the possibility of getting a spot at the 2012 Olympics. Unfortunately, she did not make it as she could not clear the opening height of 4.25 meters (13 feet, 11 ¼ inches).</p><p class=align-left>Her professional career in pole-vaulting seemed to have come to an end.</p><h3>Changing careers</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/77c34aae61eb88fe.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Annie Lederman bio: Amazing facts about the talented comedian</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While her prospects in pole vaulting seemed to have come to an end, her athletic nature opened up newer fronts to be conquered.

One year later, she also modelled for Uniqlo.</p><p class=align-left>She then teamed up with GoPro, where she recorded several videos of herself pole vaulting with a camera attached to it.
