<time>02 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Crown</i></a> Season 5&nbsp;unfolds with riveting tales that delve deep into the annals of&nbsp;the <a href=# title="royal family" data-link=tag>royal family</a>’s history, shedding light on&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the most scandalous events that have captivated the world. As&nbsp;the widely acclaimed series continues its exploration of&nbsp;the British monarchy, viewers are invited to&nbsp;witness a&nbsp;dramatic portrayal of&nbsp;the intricacies, controversies, and behind-the-scenes revelations that have shaped the course of&nbsp;regal history. Join&nbsp;us as&nbsp;we&nbsp;investigate <strong>the details of&nbsp;the most scandalous episodes</strong>, providing insights into the impeccable storytelling that continues to&nbsp;make <i>The Crown</i> a&nbsp;compelling and iconic portrayal of&nbsp;royal life.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;brief recap of&nbsp;the events from the preceding Season 4&nbsp;for a&nbsp;quick reminder.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42a/d6a/4b8aa9576ebbe92b07da5bac22.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the last installment of&nbsp;<i>The Crown</i> Princess Diana, portrayed by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Emma Corrin</a>, and Prince Charles, played by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Josh O’Connor</a>, experienced a&nbsp;less-than-festive Christmas at&nbsp;Balmoral Castle in&nbsp;Scotland. They had unsuccessfully sought <a href=# title="Queen Elizabeth" data-link=tag>Queen Elizabeth</a>’s, depicted by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Olivia Colman</a>, approval for a&nbsp;separation to&nbsp;escape their troubled marriage.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;the fourth season, both <a href=# title=Queen data-link=tag>Queen</a> Elizabeth and Prince Philip, portrayed by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tobias Menzies</a>, adamantly rejected the idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;future king getting a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>, treating Diana and Charles as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were disobedient children.</p><p>The fifth season featured an&nbsp;entirely new cast, and viewers witnessed a&nbsp;significant transformation in&nbsp;Diana and Charles as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Elizabeth Debicki</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dominic West</a> took on&nbsp;the roles. Portraying them as&nbsp;mature individuals who are no&nbsp;longer insecure and subservient to&nbsp;the dictates of&nbsp;the royal machinery, this new portrayal reveals a&nbsp;determination in&nbsp;Diana and Charles to&nbsp;seize control of&nbsp;their destinies, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means causing unprecedented collateral damage within the British monarchy.</p><p><h2>Symbolism of&nbsp;the Queen and The Royal Yacht Britannia</h2></p><p><i>The Crown</i> masterfully employs metaphors and symbolism, and Season 5&nbsp;is no&nbsp;exception, particularly in&nbsp;its exploration of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Royal Yacht Britannia</a> in&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth. Delving into the subtleties viewers may have missed, Episode 1&nbsp;unfolds with a&nbsp;black and white flashback featuring <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Claire Foy</a> as&nbsp;the Queen, delivering a&nbsp;significant speech about her newly commissioned Royal Yacht, the Britannia. This vessel, we&nbsp;learn, holds not only personal importance for her but for the entire royal family.</p><p>Fast-forwarding to&nbsp;the present day, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Imelda Staunton</a> assumes the role of&nbsp;the Queen, expressing concerns about the yacht’s maintenance and drawing parallels between it&nbsp;and another palace. Despite likening it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;palace, the Queen asserts a&nbsp;stronger connection to&nbsp;Britannia because she played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;its commissioning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd3/081/24bc5b5745afc5fc790f03b2eb.jpg><p>Simultaneously, as&nbsp;public opinion surfaces in&nbsp;British newspapers, indicating a&nbsp;desire for Queen Elizabeth to&nbsp;step down, criticisms of&nbsp;being “old” and “stuffy” abound, with a&nbsp;consensus favoring Charles as&nbsp;her successor. The Queen finds herself negotiating for funds to&nbsp;repair Britannia, symbolizing her effort to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;the past. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peter Morgan</a> skillfully mirrors this situation, portraying the monarchy as&nbsp;outdated, and the public calling for the Queen’s figurative decommission, even as&nbsp;Britannia slips away.</p><p>In&nbsp;the season’s culmination, Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair proposes a&nbsp;forward-thinking solution involving the decommissioning of&nbsp;Britannia. This decision becomes emblematic of&nbsp;a&nbsp;more progressive Britain, less enthralled by&nbsp;the spectacle of&nbsp;the monarchy and more focused on&nbsp;embracing a&nbsp;modern future.</p><p><h2>Parallels between Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e3b/74f/460f0c528dbdee1d3184cc4a29.jpeg><p>Beyond the metaphor of&nbsp;Elizabeth and Britannia, the royal yacht also holds significance in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;Princess Diana’s impending tragedy in&nbsp;Season&nbsp;5. One could argue that the pervasive sense of&nbsp;doom surrounding Britannia extends to&nbsp;Diana as&nbsp;well. Diana had been navigating her own course for a&nbsp;considerable time until she reached a&nbsp;point where she decided it&nbsp;was time for a&nbsp;change.</p><p><i>The Crown </i>Season 5&nbsp;unfolds with the renowned BBC interview, featuring memorable moments such as&nbsp;Diana stating, “There were three of&nbsp;us in&nbsp;this marriage.” She challenges the system that treated her unfairly, leading to&nbsp;the Queen eventually granting a&nbsp;divorce for Charles and Diana. The negotiations over the divorce settlements parallel the discussions about Britannia’s repairs, all while the irreparable marriage sinks.</p><p>This theme reaches its zenith in&nbsp;the Season 5&nbsp;finale, titled “Decommissioned.” In&nbsp;a&nbsp;poignant portrayal by&nbsp;Imelda Staunton, the Queen bids her final farewells while wandering around Britannia. This is&nbsp;artfully intertwined with scenes of&nbsp;Princess Diana preparing for a&nbsp;holiday with her sons and the Fayeds. Diana, too, is&nbsp;bidding adieu to&nbsp;a&nbsp;life she wishes to&nbsp;leave behind. As&nbsp;she gazes at&nbsp;her reflection in&nbsp;the mirror, a&nbsp;farewell smile graces her face. Her time as&nbsp;a&nbsp;royal is&nbsp;now in&nbsp;the past. The scene seamlessly transitions to&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth, her face partially revealed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror. Diana and Elizabeth are reflections of&nbsp;each other: one, the reigning Queen, and the other, the one destined for the role.</p><p><h2>Princess Anne</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/719/126/f128c15dc2a525129a6ed1e8e6.jpg><p>This season of&nbsp;<i>The Crown</i> faces disruptions from the tumultuous relationship between Charles and Diana, which is&nbsp;justifiable. However, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence, certain characters receive less on-screen attention. Notably, Princess Anne, a&nbsp;beloved and forthright character, appears to&nbsp;have aged and gained even more wisdom after her separation. An&nbsp;easily overlooked detail is&nbsp;the mention of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her books in&nbsp;the early episodes of&nbsp;Season&nbsp;5, where she presents it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Queen for perusal. This brief reference provides viewers with a&nbsp;glimpse into Princess Anne’s diverse activities and a&nbsp;hint at&nbsp;her intriguing life.</p><p>Princess Anne is&nbsp;recognized for her literary contributions, with three credited books to&nbsp;her name. These range from a&nbsp;book derived from a&nbsp;lecture on&nbsp;community punishment to&nbsp;an&nbsp;exploration of&nbsp;her passion for horses and her experiences in&nbsp;the Olympics. The narrative subtly reveals facets of&nbsp;Anne’s life beyond the central plot, adding depth to&nbsp;her character.</p><p>It’s always fascinating to&nbsp;delve into the lives of&nbsp;lesser-highlighted members of&nbsp;the royal family. Princess Anne, in&nbsp;particular, could easily command an&nbsp;entire episode dedicated to&nbsp;her if&nbsp;the producers chose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so. Claudia Harrison, the new actress portraying Princess Anne, expressed her admiration for the character in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with the Radio Times, stating, “I&nbsp;think I’m playing the best royal! She’s a&nbsp;proper feminist. She doesn’t put a&nbsp;foot wrong, and she leads by&nbsp;example.” It’s a&nbsp;sentiment that many viewers might share—a desire for more screen time devoted to&nbsp;Princess Anne and her compelling story.</p><p><h2>Desert Island Discs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb3/032/ee2f0f5f18b31557dd4d038c0c.jpg><p>Another storyline revisits Princess Margaret, who was a&nbsp;focal point in&nbsp;the initial two seasons of&nbsp;the series. Early enthusiasts of&nbsp;the show have expressed a&nbsp;yearning for the vibrant Princess. Her appearance in&nbsp;Season 5&nbsp;is poignant, shedding light on&nbsp;lost love and the possibilities that might have been. Margaret is&nbsp;featured on&nbsp;the radio show “Desert Island Discs,” a&nbsp;real segment that premiered in&nbsp;1981 and can be&nbsp;listened to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Although the current season of&nbsp;<i>The Crown</i> is&nbsp;set in&nbsp;the 1990s, writer Peter Morgan shifts this radio appearance into that decade to&nbsp;reconnect Margaret with her first love, Peter Townsend. This moment serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;poignant reminder for Townsend when he&nbsp;hears Margaret on&nbsp;the radio, selecting a&nbsp;song that held special meaning for them during their time together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple.</p><p>Only those well-versed in&nbsp;the Princess’s history would notice the inaccuracies in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the timeline and song choices&nbsp;— she purportedly included a&nbsp;passage from “Swan Lake.”</p><p>Peter Morgan might be&nbsp;alluding to&nbsp;this when, later in&nbsp;the season, Princess Diana watches a&nbsp;ballet production of&nbsp;“Swan Lake.” The music takes center stage, persisting as&nbsp;the Princess departs and converses with Mohammed Al-Fayed, the father of&nbsp;her future lover Dodi. Depending on&nbsp;how deeply one delves into&nbsp;it, this could be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;poetic connection between Margaret and Diana. Margaret, possessing a&nbsp;significant personality and flair, also experiences her spark diminishing within the confines of&nbsp;the royal system. Both women grapple with <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> challenges and find themselves in&nbsp;marriages that wear them down, ultimately without discovering true love.</p><p><h2>Princess Diana and fashion<br></h2></p><p>Exploring further into Diana’s character, <i>The Crown</i> Season 5&nbsp;showcases a&nbsp;selection of&nbsp;outfits that may be&nbsp;familiar to&nbsp;viewers, given Diana’s highly acclaimed and extensively documented ’90s <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a>. Following her separation and divorce, Diana gains the freedom to&nbsp;choose her wardrobe, and these distinctive outfits make appearances in&nbsp;the latest season, including the combination of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sweatshirt with biker shorts and the notorious revenge dress. <i>People</i> magazine recently delved into her impact on&nbsp;the fashion world, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noting</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;article that “Some of&nbsp;her most casual moments have sparked massive trends, such as&nbsp;the recent resurgence in&nbsp;athleisure.” The article names her style as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;“timeless elegance.”</p><p>The new season accurately captures Diana’s style. A&nbsp;Netflix <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>article</a> discussing the Harvard sweatshirt worn by&nbsp;Diana in&nbsp;real life mentioned, “Harvard made the original ’90s sweatshirt for&nbsp;us,” underscoring the significance of&nbsp;these details.</p><p><h2>The BBC Interview<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/49c/034/e8c99a5c3d9688bb99117cd037.jpeg><p>Another crucial plot point to&nbsp;analyze is&nbsp;the infamous BBC “Panorama” interview with Princess Diana, led by&nbsp;journalist Martin Bashir. This interview acted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;catalyst for the eventual divorce between Diana and Charles, and was a&nbsp;significant moment for Princess Diana to&nbsp;finally voice her truth about the way she had been treated. Unfortunately, the logistics surrounding this interview were rooted in&nbsp;deceit. In&nbsp;<i>The Crown</i> Bashir is&nbsp;shown forging payment documents that serve as&nbsp;“proof” that individuals close to&nbsp;Diana are being paid to&nbsp;spy on&nbsp;her, including her private secretary. Bashir presents these to&nbsp;Lord Spencer, Diana’s brother, who initially trusts Bashir’s word.</p><p>Playing into Diana’s paranoia, Bashir meets with the Princess and offers her the opportunity to&nbsp;share her side of&nbsp;the story in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tell-all interview. Driven by&nbsp;anxiety and fear, Diana agrees to&nbsp;proceed with&nbsp;it. What viewers may not know, however, is&nbsp;that the truth behind Bashir’s manipulation was not revealed until 2021. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Lord John Dyson disclosed this revelation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;report on&nbsp;the reality of&nbsp;Bashir’s deceit. It’s an&nbsp;unjust sequence of&nbsp;events, especially for the Princess, who had already struggled with mental health issues in&nbsp;the previous decade.</p><p>Despite the frustration it&nbsp;evokes, it&nbsp;makes for compelling television. The secretive nature of&nbsp;the interview, Bashir’s unethical means of&nbsp;securing&nbsp;it, and even the way in&nbsp;which the&nbsp;TV crew has to&nbsp;sneak into Kensington Palace disguised as&nbsp;audio equipment installers give the entire event the nail-biting tension akin to&nbsp;a&nbsp;heist movie, as&nbsp;described in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>Vogue</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>article</a>.</p><p><h2>King George V&nbsp;and his parrot Charlotte</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/12b/838/1db2e95c8ab074a93fd4934a6a.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;fascinating detail about the former monarch involves a&nbsp;sizable parrot perched on&nbsp;his shoulder. This element seems almost fantastical, resembling something one might encounter in&nbsp;the royal realms of&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i> rather than in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;<i>The Crown</i>. While it’s not unusual for royals to&nbsp;have pets&nbsp;— we’re accustomed to&nbsp;the Queen and her group of&nbsp;corgis, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;her affection for horses&nbsp;— the choice of&nbsp;a&nbsp;parrot adds an&nbsp;intriguing touch.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode addressing Elizabeth’s loneliness, it’s a&nbsp;touching realization that King George was never entirely alone, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;did, in&nbsp;fact, have a&nbsp;parrot named Charlotte. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Wonders and Marvels</a>, George acquired Charlotte during his youth, and the bird would perch on&nbsp;his Majesty’s shoulder, serving as&nbsp;“a&nbsp;critical eye over state papers and confidential documents, shouting ’What about it?’ in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Stentorian voice.” Reportedly, when George fell ill, Charlotte was the first visitor he&nbsp;requested. It’s undeniably peculiar but oddly heartwarming.</p><p><h2>King in&nbsp;waiting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/861/1d4/b62ffc59a98f054481e9c683c5.jpg><p><i>The Crown</i> Season 5&nbsp;lays the groundwork for Charles to&nbsp;eventually ascend to&nbsp;the throne, even though we&nbsp;are aware that this won’t happen for quite some time. Amid his separation from Diana, Charles is&nbsp;depicted as&nbsp;growing restless. The private conversation he&nbsp;has with Prime Minister John Major reveals his expressed desire to&nbsp;become king before aging further, drawing a&nbsp;parallel to&nbsp;Queen Victoria’s eldest son.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;reality, Sir John Major dismissed this conversation as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“barrel load of&nbsp;malicious nonsense” (via <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>the Daily Mail</i></a>). The examination of&nbsp;Queen Victoria and her son serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror and foreshadowing for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. Subtle details, such as&nbsp;describing him as&nbsp;“empathetic” and “impressive,” prepare viewers for his future role as&nbsp;king.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a29/722/6158675ab99259feea30b2eaec.jpg><p>While setting the stage for King Charles, Peter Morgan doesn’t shy away from exposing some of&nbsp;his most notorious scandals, including a&nbsp;leaked phone call with Camilla. It’s a&nbsp;challenging scene to&nbsp;watch, but it’s a&nbsp;necessary element of&nbsp;the 1990s storyline. Peter Morgan concludes the episode by&nbsp;showcasing Charles’ charity work for The Prince’s Fund.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;review of&nbsp;the season for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Esquire</i></a>, Rachel Dodes aptly summarizes this choice: “It&nbsp;feels almost as&nbsp;though Morgan is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;apologize to&nbsp;Charles for dredging up&nbsp;the mortifying scandal.” It’s an&nbsp;audacious decision, especially given the current real-life situation with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>King Charles</a> finally ascending to&nbsp;the throne.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYycqaivnmLApq3SqKVmbV2ouqK4y2abnqyRnrm0ediorGalka56qa3VnmSmoaOosqV5l2puaWlhZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-crown-season-5-small-details-you-may-have-missed-817011.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-crown-season-5-small-details-you-may-have-missed-817011.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-crown-season-5-small-details-you-may-have-missed-817011.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-crown-season-5-small-details-you-may-have-missed-817011.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-crown-season-5-small-details-you-may-have-missed-817011.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-crown-season-5-small-details-you-may-have-missed-817011.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-to-do-when-you-see-a-snake-and-how-to-tell-if-its-venomous-641760.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-to-do-when-you-see-a-snake-and-how-to-tell-if-its-venomous-641760.html>What toDoWhen You See aSnake and How toTell IfIts Venomous</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./russia-arrest-warrant-alexander-rodnyansky-ukraine-war-1235616547.html>Russia Issues Arrest Warrant for Oscar-Nominated Producer Alexander Rodnyansky Over Criticism</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./russia-arrest-warrant-alexander-rodnyansky-ukraine-war-1235616547.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
