How about nuclear power?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: OK. That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat grass. The same stuff. Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. Why do you suppose that is?</p><p class=align-left>Stranger: Jeez, I have no idea.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Well, then. How is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know sh*t?</p><p class=align-left><strong>2.

During his brother's honeymoon</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>(Fred and Mary got married, but can't afford a honeymoon, so they go back to Fred's parent's home for their first night together.

A story from his aunt's house</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>(On his way home from school, Little Johnny stops at his aunt's house. He sees his father and aunt kissing passionately and stripping off their clothes. So Little Johnny returns home to tell his mother about the story.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: I went to Aunt Karen's house and saw daddy giving a big kiss to Aunt Karen, taking her shirt off, and taking her pants off. Then aunt Karen…</p><p class=align-left><i>(Shocked and angry, his mom interrupts)</i></p><p class=align-left>Mother: Little Johnny, this is such a great story. I don't want your dad to miss it. Can you tell your story again at the dinner tonight? I want to see your dad's face when he hears it.</p><p class=align-left><i>(Later that day, the family is having dinner, and the mom asks Little Johnny to tell his story.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Well, I went to Aunt Karen's house, and I saw daddy giving aunt Karen a big kiss, and then he took off her shirt. And then aunt Karen helped daddy take off his pants, and then daddy and aunt Karen did that same thing that mom and uncle Joe used to do when daddy was away on his <a href=#>business</a> trips!</p><p class=align-left><strong>5. Mom is busy</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>(Little Johnny's mother was frantically attempting to get the ketchup out of the bottle. When the phone rang during her battle, she requested four-year-old Johnny to answer it. Johnny dashed into the living room and picked up the phone.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Mommy, it's the minister.</p><p class=align-left>Mom: Tell him I'll call him back.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/87cb09a5379a05ac.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>6. Johnny is trying to answer a question</strong></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: If I gave you 2 cats and another 2 cats and another 2, how many would you have?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Seven.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: No, listen carefully... If I gave you two cats, and another two cats and another two, how many would you have?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Seven.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Let me put it to you differently. If I gave you two apples, and another two apples and another two, how many would you have?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Six.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Good. Now, if I gave you two cats, and another two cats and another two, how many would you have?</p><p class=align-left>Johnny: Seven!</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Johnny, wherein the heck do you get seven from?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Because I've already got a freaking cat!</p><p class=align-left><strong>7. What parents did</strong></p><p class=align-left>During parent-teacher conferences, the teachers asked the students what their parents did. Little Johnny said that his father is a magician. The teacher asked what his favourite magic trick was. Johnny said, "Well, he likes to cut people in half. I have two half-siblings."</p><p class=align-left><strong>8. Spending a day with mom</strong></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Mom, I'm bored. I want to do something.</p><p class=align-left>Mom: See those construction workers building that house across the street? Why don't you go over there and see what they are doing, maybe you'll learn something?</p><p class=align-left><i>(So Johnny does what his mom told him and spends all day across the street. Finally, he comes home in time for dinner.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Mom: So Johnny, what did you learn today?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Well, first the mason comes and pours the f*cking slab, then the carpenter puts up the c*cksucking frame, and finally the interior guy shows up and finishes the goddamn drywall.</p><p class=align-left>Mom: Johnny! I'm going to whup your little b*tt. Go out back and fetch me a switch.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: F*ck you, that's the electrician's job.</p><p class=align-left><strong>9. The teacher decided to ask the class a riddle</strong></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Does anyone know how to put 2 holes into one hole?</p><p class=align-left><i>(None of the children knew the answer, so it was their homework to go home and figure out how to put 2 holes into one. The students returned the next day and still didn't know the answer.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: I will show you the answer now, children.</p><p class=align-left><i>(He proceeds to hold his pointer finger against his thumb, making a little ring. He then puts the ring he made with his fingers over his nose and says)</i></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Look, here is the hole I made with my fingers, and it is covering the 2 holes on my nose.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Excuse me, sir, but do you know how to put 7 holes into one hole?</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: I have no idea, Johnny; why don't you tell us how you put 7 holes into one hole?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: You simply sit on your recorder, sir.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fcbe21ec55d07aea.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>10. Teacher trying to teach good manners</strong></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Michael, if you were having dinner with a lovely young lady on a date, how would you tell her that you have to go to the bathroom?</p><p class=align-left>Michael: Just a minute, I have to go pee.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: That would be rude and impolite. What about you, Sherman? How would you say it?</p><p class=align-left>Sherman: I am sorry, but I really need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: That's better, but it's still not very nice to say the word bathroom at the dinner table. And you, little Johnny, can you use your brain for once and show us your good manners?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: I would say, Darling, may I please be excused for a moment? I have to shake hands with a very dear friend of mine, who I hope to introduce you to after dinner.</p><p class=align-left><strong>11. Family's pet rooster dead</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>(When Little Johnny returned home from school, he discovered the family's beloved rooster had died in the front yard. It was flat on its back with its legs in the air, suffering from rigour Mortis. When his father returned home, he said)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Dad, our rooster is dead, and his legs are sticking in the air. Why are his legs like that?</p><p class=align-left>Father: Son, that's so God can reach down from the clouds and lift the rooster straight up to heaven.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Gee, dad, that's great.</p><p class=align-left><i>(A few days later, when Dad came home from work, Billy rushed out to meet him, yelling)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Dad! Dad, we almost lost mom today!</p><p class=align-left>Father: What do you mean?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Well, dad, I got home from school early today and went up to your bedroom, and there was mom, flat on her back with her legs in the air, screaming, 'Jesus, I'm coming! I'm coming!' If it hadn't been for Uncle George holding her down, we'd have lost her for sure!</p><p class=align-left><strong>12. Asking his father a question</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>(One day, while Johnny's dad was just getting out of the shower, Johnny looked down and said)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Dad, what's that hanging between your legs?</p><p class=align-left>Dad: Oh Johnny, that's my nerve, and your's will be this big one of these days.</p><p class=align-left><i>(Anyway, the next day, while in school, Johnny really had to pee, so he raised his hand and said)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Miss, I really need to go to the bathroom.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: No, not yet. There's someone gone.</p><p class=align-left><i>(Not able to hold it in, Johnny walks to the garbage can and starts to pee. Surprised to see her student pe*ing in a garbage can in front of the whole class, the teacher says)</i></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Johnny, you have some nerve!</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: That's nothing you should see, my fathers.</p><p class=align-left><strong>13. Teacher making a bet with Johnny</strong></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Teacher, I'll bet you $50. I can guess what colour your underwear is.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: OK, meet me after class, and we'll settle it.</p><p class=align-left><i>(Before class ends, she goes to the restroom and removes her underwear. After class is over and the students clear out, Johnny makes his guess.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Blue.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Nope. You got it wrong. <i>(As she lifts her skirt to reveal she isn't wearing any underwear.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: Well, come with me out to my dad's car, he's waiting for me, and I'll get you the money.</p><p class=align-left><i>(When they get to the car, she informs his dad that he got the bet wrong and that she showed Johnny that she wasn't wearing any underwear.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Dad: That mother f*cker! He bet me $100 this morning that he'd see your p*ssy before the end of the day!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/865c5b5f617cf98a.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>14. Why are you laughing</strong></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Why did you laugh?</p><p class=align-left>Student: I saw a strap of your bra.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Get out! Don't come to class for the next 1 week.</p><p class=align-left><i>(Another student laughs)</i></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Why did you laugh?</p><p class=align-left>Student: I saw both straps of your bra.</p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Get out! Don't come to class for the next 1 month.</p><p class=align-left><i>(The teacher bends to pick chalk, and Little Johnny starts walking out of the class.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Teacher: Why are you going out?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: I think my school days are over with what I saw.</p><p class=align-left><strong>15. Homework about the government</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>(One day, a teacher was teaching her second-grade class about the government, and for homework, she encouraged her kids to question their parents about it.)</i></p><p class=align-left>When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and asked him what the government was.</p><p class=align-left>Father: Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the workforce, you are the people, and your baby brother is the future.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: I still don't get it.</p><p class=align-left>Father: Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better.</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: OK then...good night.</p><p class=align-left><i>(Little Johnny was awakened in the middle of the night by his baby brother's wailing. When he went to his baby brother's cot, he saw that he had a cr*p in his diaper. As a result, Little Johnny went to his parent's room for assistance. When he entered his parents' room, he checked through the keyhole to see if they were sleeping.)</i></p><p class=align-left><i>(He observed his mum snoring loudly through the keyhole, but his father wasn't there. As a result, he went inside the maid's room and saw his father having sex with the maid. Little Johnny was shocked, but then he realised something and expressed his thoughts loudly.)</i></p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: OH!! Now I understand the government! The president is screwing the workforce, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of sh*t!</p><p class=align-left><strong>16. Coming from Sunday school with a black eye</strong></p><p class=align-left>Father: Johnny, how many times do I have to tell you not to fight with the other boys?</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: But Dad, it wasn't my fault. We were all in church saying our prayers. We all stood up, and my teacher in front of me had her dress in the crack of her b*tt. I reached over and pulled it out. That's when she hit me!</p><p class=align-left>Father: Johnny! You don't do those kinds of things to women.</p><p class=align-left><i>(The very next Sunday, Johnny came home with the other eye black and blue)</i></p><p class=align-left>Father: Johnny, I thought we had a talk!</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny: But Dad, it wasn't my fault. There we were in church, saying our prayers. We all stood up, and my teacher in front of us had her dress in the crack of her b*tt. Then Louie, who was sitting next to me, saw it, and he reached over and pulled it out. Now I know she doesn't like this, so I pushed it back in!</p><p class=align-left>Little Johnny's jokes are guaranteed to make you laugh. The wording and phrases used are hilarious.
