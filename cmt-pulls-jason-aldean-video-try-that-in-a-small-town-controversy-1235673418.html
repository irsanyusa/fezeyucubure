Reps for Aldean’s label, BBR Music Group, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. <a href=#>Billboard</a> was first to report the video being removed by the network.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, Aldean took to his social media Tuesday afternoon to defend the song from its many critics, taking a much softer tone in his messaging than he does in the hostile single itself, or a video that projects images of demonstrators onto a courthouse that was the site of a famous lynching.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“In the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless, but dangerous,” Aldean wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn’t a single video clip that isn’t real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far. As so many pointed out, I was present at Route 91-where so many lost their lives- and our community recently suffered another heartbreaking tragedy. NO ONE, including me, wants to continue to see senseless headlines or families ripped apart.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Aldean tried to paint the song as taking a positive attitude on small towns, and downplayed the belligerent threats to outsiders that make up most of the lyrics, not to mention the stock footage of protesters that takes up a good portion of the video’s running time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“‘Try That In A Small Town,’ for me, refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief. Because they were our neighbors, and that was above any differences. My political views have never been something I’ve hidden from, and I know that a lot of us in this country don’t agree on how we get back to a sense of normalcy where we go at least a day without a headline that keeps us up at night. But the desire for it to — that’s what this song is about.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">His tweet with that message did not assuage those who have seen anger toward city dwellers or even racial dog whistles in the video, which was filmed in front of a courthouse in Colombia, Tennessee that is well known for having been the sight of a lynching of a Black man in the 1920s. Aldean did not address the part of the controversy that specifically has to do with the racially charge location.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While the video’s fate at CMT is settled, it remains to be seen whether there will be any similar fallout at country radio or if the format will stand behind the already deeply divisive song.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Country Aircheck’s add chart on Monday showed the single having been added to 125 stations, which normally would augur for a major hit. (The highest number of stations reporting adds for any current hit is 156.) It looks to be a major success, from that start, although not nearly as strong as Dan + Shay’s “Save Me the Trouble,” which got 134 adds right out of the box this week and has a clearer path to No. 1.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Variety addressed the Aldean controversy Wednesday in a commentary: <a href=#>“Jason Aldean Already Had the Most Contemptible Country Song of the Decade. The Video Is Worse.”</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests.

The singer was dropped by his publicity firm after making a series of statements that including helping sell anti-Biden clothing for children and telling his audience that he did not want to see any masks in the audience. He also co-signed statements by his wife that the LGBTQ+ community viewed as transphobic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjqasrKGTZLumw9JomqasXaXCrbjSZqGaq5%2BjeqK4w56Yp2WmnrGmu4ytqbJlpJ2utXnIp2SaZaOirq24jK2msKZdmLyvwNGorZ6qo656cn6Sbm1wa2RmhXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcmt-pulls-jason-aldean-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-controversy-1235673418.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcmt-pulls-jason-aldean-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-controversy-1235673418.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcmt-pulls-jason-aldean-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-controversy-1235673418.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcmt-pulls-jason-aldean-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-controversy-1235673418.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcmt-pulls-jason-aldean-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-controversy-1235673418.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcmt-pulls-jason-aldean-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-controversy-1235673418.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./frank-ocean-watch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./frank-ocean-watch.html>Frank Ocean Watch | Time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./evaluation-des-incidences-natura-2000-bouclage-des-listes-avant-fin-mars.html>bouclage des listes avant fin mars</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./evaluation-des-incidences-natura-2000-bouclage-des-listes-avant-fin-mars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
