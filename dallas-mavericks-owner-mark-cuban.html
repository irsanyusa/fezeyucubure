Only this time, it’s the Securities and Exchange Commission he’ll be fending off. Cuban, who co-founded Broadcast.com and sold it to Yahoo! for billions, was <a href=# rel=noopener>charged on Nov. 17 with insider trading</a>, accused of using non-public information to avoid losing $750,000 on a 2004 stock sale. Cuban has denied the charges, saying on his <a href=# rel=noopener>blog</a>, “The government’s claims are false and they will be proven to be so.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Fast Facts:</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• He was born in Pittsburgh in 1958, the son of a car upholsterer named Norton. Growing up, he was an overweight kid with Coke-bottle glasses, devoted to stamp and coin collecting. He wanted to be rich from a very young age, selling everything from garbage bags to magazine subscriptions door-to-door to make money.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• He attended the University of Indiana, where he played rugby and bought a nightclub that he named Motley’s. He says he had to shut down the bar when authorities discovered that the winner of an in-house wet T-shirt contest was a 16-year-old girl on probation for prostitution.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• After college, he worked at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, where he learned about computing technology. He quit after a few years and moved to Dallas in 1982, where he eventually started a consulting and computer company that he sold for $6 million in 1990. After the sale, Cuban moved to Los Angeles and played roles in several small movies. (He later appeared in several episodes of <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• In the mid 1990s, Cuban co-founded the company that would become Broadcast.com, which started as a web site to access live sports games online. The company went on to broadcast other content — including Bill Clinton’s testimony in the Monica Lewinsky affair and a Victoria’s Secret fashion show. Cuban and his partner took Broadcast.com public and sold it to Yahoo! in 1999 for $5.7 billion in stock.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• In 2000, Cuban bought the NBA Dallas Mavericks for $280 million. He is known for screaming at referees while sitting courtside. In 2002, he was fined $500,000 by the NBA for, among other things, saying of a ref: “I wouldn’t hire him to manage a Dairy Queen.” As a publicity stunt, Cuban filled in for one day as a manager at a Texas Dairy Queen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• Nearly 20 years ago — after he made his first million dollars — Cuban bought a lifetime American Airlines pass and flew all over the world. In 2000, he bought his own jet for a reported $40 million, over e-mail.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• In 2001, Cuban <a href=# rel=noopener>co-founded HDNet</a>, a high-definition television network. The current programming line-up includes <i>Dan Rather Reports</i>. Cuban also owns or co-owns a film production company, chain of movie theaters and the web site sharesleuth.com, which is devoted, in part, to investigating securities fraud. His film production company, HDNet Movies, came under heavy fire in 2007 for financing the movie <i>Redacted</i> about an incident in which U.S. soldiers raped and killed a 14-year-old Iraqi girl.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• His nicknames have included “Pudgy” and “Cubes”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• He loves wiffle ball, 70s funk, e-mail (he thinks the telephone is an antiquated way of communicating),<i> The Fountainhead</i> and the movie <i>Risky Business</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• He competed on the 2007 season of ABC’s <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, shortly after having hip replacement surgery.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• He has two young daughters with wife, Tiffany, whom he married in 2002.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">• His ability to influence pretty much any industry he touches — along with his apparent obsession with being rich and famous — has made him ripe for <a href=# rel=noopener>parody</a> as a pushy, arrogant, no-holds-barred executive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Quotes about Cuban:</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He’s a smart man. He didn’t become a billionaire by accident.”<br>— Mavericks forward Jerry Stackhouse, on Cuban’s success in bringing the team to the NBA Finals for the first time in the franchise’s 26-year history <i>(Washington Post, June 8, 2006)</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Mark is a total loser.
