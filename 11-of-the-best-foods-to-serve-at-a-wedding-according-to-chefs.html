"Because Jewish weddings tend to be large, I suggest creating a menu with entrees that are slow-cooked or braised, such as short ribs or Moroccan lamb stew. This way, you won't have to concern yourself with the rare vs. well-done debate among guests," Meirelles told INSIDER.</p><p>Banquet sous chef Melanie Cuartelon of <a href=# id=de3f76ea-1542-334d-a86a-7206dd4cd79c>Sawgrass Marriott Golf Resort & Spa</a> in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida regularly creates wedding menus at her popular event venueand agreed that braised meats work wonderfully for large parties. Her particular favorite is raised short ribs.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Braised short ribs are not only delicious, [but] they're the perfect addition to a wedding menu. The fact that they pair well with so many different side dishes (mashed potatoes, risotto, pasta, polenta, etc.) allows for more customization based on the bride and groom's preferences. Whether the couple has chosen a buffet or a plated menu, braised short ribs make for a beautiful presentation. As a bonus, it's a cost effective item for brides on a budget," Curatelon explained.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>When choosing side dishes for your reception, skip the flavorless steaming and blanching and go for roasted veggies instead.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d353b28a-6f00-453c-860f-ab55b601d809 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/BxpktkuTURBXy9hN2YwZTBlMy0xYWNkLTQ4NGYtOGIzNy1iN2U5NzVmN2VhNWQuanBlZ5GVAs0B9M0BTcLD></span><p>beebrulee/Flickr</p><p>Blanched and steamed vegetables show up constantly on catered menus, largely due to their easy prep, but in most circumstances, you'll sacrifice flavor for the sake of getting large quantities done in a timely manner.

"[Chicken Francaise] is one of my favorite entrees for a wedding. [It's] a beautiful chicken breast that is herb-breaded and then pan-sauteed with a lemon-caper sauce.

"Citrus and herb encrusted Chilean sea bass with Mediterranean couscous and a tomato coulis [is a] light yet filling dish [that] features bright flavors perfect for a memorable wedding dining option.
