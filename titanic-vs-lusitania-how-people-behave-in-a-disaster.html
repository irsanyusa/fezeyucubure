The human species may have developed an elaborate social and behavioral code, but we drop it fast when we’re scared enough — as any stampeding mob reveals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That primal push-pull is at work during wars, natural disasters and any other time our hides are on the line. It was perhaps never more poignantly played out than during the two greatest maritime disasters in history: the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> and the <i>Lusitania</i>. A team of behavioral economists from Switzerland and Australia have published a new paper in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> (<i>PNAS</i>) that takes an imaginative new look at who survived and who perished aboard the two ships, and what the demographics of death say about how well social norms hold up in a crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(See the top 10 scientific discoveries of 2009.)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <i>Lusitania</i> and the <i>Titanic</i> are often thought of as sister vessels; they in fact belonged to two separate owners, but the error is understandable. Both ships were huge: the <i>Titanic</i> was carrying 2,207 passengers and crew on the night it went down; the <i>Lusitania</i> had 1,949. The mortality figures were even closer, with a 68.7% death rate aboard the <i>Titanic</i> and 67.3% for the <i>Lusitania.</i> What’s more, the ships sank just three years apart — the <i>Titanic</i> was claimed by an iceberg on April 14, 1912, and the <i>Lusitania</i> by a German U-Boat on May 7, 1915. But on the decks and in the passageways and all the other places where people fought for their lives, the vessels’ respective ends played out very differently.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To study those differences, the authors of the <i>PNAS</i> paper — Bruno Frey of the University of Zurich and David Savage and Benno Torgler of Queensland University — combed through <i>Titanic</i> and <i>Lusitania</i> data to gather the age, gender and ticket class for every passenger aboard, as well as the number of family members traveling with them. They also noted who survived and who didn’t.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(See a survival guide to catastrophe.)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With this information in hand, they separated out one key group: all third-class passengers age 35 or older who were traveling with no children. The researchers figured that these were the people who faced the greatest likelihood of death because they were old enough, unfit enough and deep enough below the decks to have a hard time making it to a lifeboat. What’s more, traveling without children may have made them slightly less motivated to struggle for survival and made other people less likely to let them pass. This demographic slice then became the so-called reference group, and the survival rates of all the other passenger groups were compared to theirs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The results told a revealing tale. Aboard the <i>Titanic,</i> children under 16 years old were nearly 31% likelier than the reference group to have survived, but those on the <i>Lusitania</i> were 0.7% less likely. Males ages 16 to 35 on the <i>Titanic</i> had a 6.5% poorer survival rate than the reference group but did 7.9% better on the <i>Lusitania.</i> For females in the 16-to-35 group, the gap was more dramatic: those on the <i>Titanic</i> enjoyed a whopping 48.3% edge; on the <i>Lusitania</i> it was a smaller but still significant 10.4%. The most striking survival disparity — no surprise, given the era — was determined by class. The <i>Titanic</i>‘s first-class passengers had a 43.9% greater chance of making it off the ship and into a lifeboat than the reference group; the <i>Lusitania</i>‘s, remarkably, were 11.5% less likely.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(See pictures of the <i>Queen Elizabeth 2</i>‘s final voyage.)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There were a lot of factors behind these two distinct survival profiles — the most significant being time. Most shipwrecks are comparatively slow-motion disasters, but there are varying degrees of slow. The <i>Lusitania</i> slipped below the waves a scant 18 min. after the German torpedo hit it. The <i>Titanic</i> stayed afloat for 2 hr. 40 min. — and human behavior differed accordingly. On the <i>Lusitania</i>, the authors of the new paper wrote, “the short-run flight impulse dominated behavior. On the slowly sinking <i>Titanic</i>, there was time for socially determined behavioral patterns to reemerge.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That theory fits perfectly with the survival data, as all of the <i>Lusitania</i>‘s passengers were more likely to engage in what’s known as selfish rationality — a behavior that’s every bit as me-centered as it sounds and that provides an edge to strong, younger males in particular. On the <i>Titanic</i>, the rules concerning gender, class and the gentle treatment of children — in other words, good manners — had a chance to assert themselves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Precisely how long it takes before decorum reappears is impossible to say, but simple biology would put it somewhere between the 18-min. and 2-hr. 40-min. windows that the two ships were accorded. “Biologically, fight-or-flight behavior has two distinct stages,” the researchers wrote. “The short-term response [is] a surge in adrenaline production. This response is limited to a few minutes, because adrenaline degrades rapidly. Only after returning to homeostasis do the higher-order brain functions of the neocortex begin to override instinctual responses.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once that happened aboard the <i>Titanic</i>, there were officers present to restore a relative sense of order and to disseminate information about what had just happened and what needed to be done next. Contemporary evacuation experts know that rapid communication of accurate information is critical in such emergencies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(See TIME’s health and medicine covers.)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other variables beyond the question of time played important roles too. The <i>Lusitania</i>‘s passengers may have been more prone to stampede than those aboard the <i>Titanic</i> because they were traveling in wartime and were aware that they could come under attack at any moment. The very nature of the attack that sank the <i>Lusitania</i> — the sudden concussion of a torpedo, compared to the slow grinding of an iceberg — would also be likelier to spark panic. Finally, there was the simple fact that everyone aboard the <i>Lusitania</i> was aware of what had happened to the <i>Titanic</i> just three years earlier and thus disabused of the idea that there was any such thing as a ship that was too grand to sink — their own included.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fact that the two vessels did sink is an unalterable fact of history, and while ship design and safety protocols have changed, the powder-keg nature of human behavior is the same as it ever was. The more scientists learn about how it played out in disasters of the past, the more they can help us minimize loss in the future.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>See the best pictures of the week.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>See the editorial cartoons of the week.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9wbGxiZoBwwMitmKehk2LDtHnLrqqirJGjtqJ5x6iuZqiVpL2tsYybnKGZppp6qrqMmmSdoaOWwLWx0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftitanic-vs-lusitania-how-people-behave-in-a-disaster.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftitanic-vs-lusitania-how-people-behave-in-a-disaster.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftitanic-vs-lusitania-how-people-behave-in-a-disaster.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftitanic-vs-lusitania-how-people-behave-in-a-disaster.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftitanic-vs-lusitania-how-people-behave-in-a-disaster.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftitanic-vs-lusitania-how-people-behave-in-a-disaster.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./remuneration-au-merite-un-bonus-recompensera-les-agents-les-plus-meritants.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./remuneration-au-merite-un-bonus-recompensera-les-agents-les-plus-meritants.html>un &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; rcompensera les agents les plus mritants</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./avicca-et-operateurs-sentend-sur-les-zones-blanches-moins-sur-la-fibre.html>on s'entend sur les zones blanches, moins sur la fibre</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./avicca-et-operateurs-sentend-sur-les-zones-blanches-moins-sur-la-fibre.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
