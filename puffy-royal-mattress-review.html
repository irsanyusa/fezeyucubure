<time>15 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There’s no better feeling than getting into bed after a long day. Heck, even for a nap it can be delightful. As someone with depression and fibromyalgia, I spend a lot of time in bed—probably too much—but I find it serves as sweet relief from the pains of daily life. I consider myself to be a mattress connoisseur as I’ve not only tested numerous beds over the years, but also have benefitted from using high-quality mattresses for my sleep needs.</p><p>The Puffy Royal Hybrid Mattress is advertised to be suitable for hot sleepers and those of all sleeping styles, so I wanted to put it to the test. After sleeping on it for 30 nights, I have insights about this mattress I want to share with you.</p><p><h3 class=title>Puffy Royal Hybrid Mattress - Queen</h3></p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-specifications>Puffy Royal Mattress specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>Material:</strong> Gel memory foam</li><li><strong>Firmness:</strong> Ultra-plush (hybrid)</li><li><strong>Trial period:</strong> 101 nights</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> Lifetime warranty</li><li><strong>Shipping method:</strong> Free ground shipping; arrives directly at your front doorstep in a box</li><li><strong>Price range:</strong> $1,249 (twin) to $2,898 (split king)</li></ul><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-pros-and-cons>Puffy Royal Mattress pros and cons</h2><h3>Pros</h3><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Puffy Royal Mattress</a> has many pros that make it stand out from the competition from delivery to construction.</p><p>First it arrives directly at your doorstep in a relatively small box. This method is preferable for those individuals who live in small houses or apartment complexes where large boxes are hard to maneuver through the hallways.</p><p>Aside from effortless delivery, it’s pretty easy to assemble and by that I mean open the box and rip off the plastic. You just need to be patient while it expands to its fullest extent.</p><p>Lastly, and arguably the most important part, is that the Puffy Royal mattress is super comfortable. I’d describe it as having a “just-right” feel that’s both soft and supportive. I didn’t find myself twisting and turning to find the sweet spot since that was essentially the entire mattress.</p><h3>Cons</h3><p>While there are many pros, it would be wrong not to point out the cons—there aren't many, but I noticed one major potential issue.</p><p>This mattress doesn’t have suitable edge support, meaning, the edges are a bit flimsy. For example, when I found myself on the edge of the bed, I was grasping to stay on the mattress. Plus, when I tried to tie my shoe, I’d start sliding down as there was no support to keep the edges intact.</p><p>It’s worth noting this may not be an issue for someone lighter or who doesn’t doomscroll on their phone on the edge of the bed at night.</p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-price>Puffy Royal Mattress price</h2><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Puffy Royal Mattress</a> is expensive, however, the brand often has deals and codes that offer additional discounts and savings. (For full transparency, I received the bed for free to test.) The <a rel=alternate href=#>queen mattress</a> is listed at $3,749, but using the current discount code at time of publishing, the price comes down to $2,399—that’s over $1,300 in savings.</p><p>In terms of price, it’s important to address that a mattress is an investment. Most people spend more than one-third of their life in bed, so it’s worth splurging to find a comfortable mattress that will give you a restful night's sleep and peace of mind.</p><p><h3 class=title>Puffy Royal Hybrid Mattress - Queen</h3></p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-design>Puffy Royal Mattress design</h2><p>The Puffy Royal Mattress boasts a 10-layer design from top to bottom starting with a quilted cloud cover. It’s made to be cool to the touch while having a cloud-like feel for optimal comfort. Then there’s blended wool filling to help wick away moisture followed by heat-resistant fibers for better air flow.</p><p>For the Royal mattress in particular, there’s a one-inch memory foam layer and contour made with cooling gel to help regulate temperature and supports the body during the night, regardless of sleep position. Next, there’s two inches of memory foam, one inch of cloud comfort foam, and two-and-a-half sculpting technology foam to aid in pressure relief, spinal alignment, and full body support.</p><p>All of these layers are stacked on top of six inches of contour-adapt coils that work to reduce bounceback, prevent motion transfer, and maintain a stable base. Last but not least, there’s a support foam layer and a grip-base cover to keep the mattress still and stable during the night.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0aa8fc460aa436549b5760afe60c6890/76902/mattress-thickness.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-firmness>Puffy Royal Mattress firmness</h2><p>It’s important to recognize that everyone has preferences when it comes to the firmness of a mattress. I prefer my mattress to be pretty firm — I like to describe it as sleeping on a cushioned coffee table, if that makes sense. According to the brand, the Puffy Royal Mattress has an ultra-plush firmness with full body support. On a scale from one to 10, I’d give this mattress a 7.5 firmness rating. It’s not the most firm mattress I’ve ever slept on, but it’s a balance of firm and supportive.</p><p>I’d disagree in saying that it’s ultra-plush due to the fact that it’s supportive. It’s soft and squishy to a degree, however, it’s not like sleeping on a cloud.</p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-support-and-comfort>Puffy Royal Mattress support and comfort</h2><p>I felt well-supported sleeping on the Puffy Royal Mattress and that is coming from a plus-size person. I didn’t feel like I sank in too much, but instead I was held up and supported during the night. As for comfort, I was generally comfortable as a stomach and side sleeper. I didn’t find myself looking for that singular sweet spot on the mattress which I have in the past.</p><p>My favorite quality of the mattress was how well it deflected heat. I didn’t find myself looking for the singular cool spot nor waking up in a puddle of sweat—which usually happens. The Puffy Royal’s optimal ventilation and breathability is made with hot sleepers in mind.</p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-performance>Puffy Royal Mattress performance</h2><p>Aside from getting a quality night’s sleep on a mattress, I usually test the mattress to determine the level of edge support and motion transfer.</p><p>To test the edge support, I rested toward the edge of the bed and noticed whether I found myself grasping to stay upright. Long story short, the edge support on this mattress was not there. I essentially rolled right off whether I was lying down or simply sitting to tie my sneakers. For me, this isn’t the end of the world since I don’t use my bed in that capacity often, however, it could be problematic if you twist and turn at night.</p><p>While I normally sleep alone, I wanted to test the motion transfer so I had my sister rest on one side of the mattress and turn. I did feel a little bit of movement as she moved around, but it wasn’t too noticeable. I don’t think it would wake me up in the middle of the night if she had to adjust the blankets or something similar.</p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-delivery-and-setup>Puffy Royal Mattress delivery and setup</h2><p>The hybrid mattress showed up at my doorstep by FedEx in a box within less than a week which I was able to carry with the help of my roommate into my apartment and open. According to the brand, the queen mattress is 105 pounds and comes in a box that’s 16 inches x 16 inches x 44 inches.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/ba3bad2b5f91e0cb228590908facf44b/76902/bed-box-name.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/8428cf7067708ac71a418a6b446711eb/76902/bed-box-side.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><p>It was pretty easy to set up since all I had to do was roll it out of the box and cut off the plastic wrap. Puffy recommended leaving the mattress to expand for two hours before lying on it and that’s exactly what I did. Compared to other mattresses I’ve reviewed, the expansion time was significantly less—usually it’s advised to wait between 24 and 48 hours.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/dcc914e8242c1a31314a8192ab9d1af6/76902/img-8698.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/79ff3ad7b0fe4232a26cf1f4ae21580c/76902/mattress-wrapped.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/89366fd99bc03f6dc3b699a1cf99d8cb/76902/mattress-in-plastic-wrap.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/fd20ab570eed342f9fa3b2a8f89e9c60/76902/mattress-flat-close-up.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/993061329d850b51cb7c8e21844a0977/76902/mattress-flat-3.jpg></span></span><p>CASEY CLARK</p><h2></h2><p>Is the Puffy Royal Mattress for you? Who is this mattress best for?</p><p>Overall, I like the Puffy Royal Mattress and would say it’s for me as someone who prefers not only a <a rel=alternate href=#>hybrid mattress</a>, but also <a rel=alternate href=#>cooling mattresses</a> in general. I’d say it’s best suited for hot sleepers, individuals who prefer a more firm mattress, and perhaps couples who are sensitive to movement as it has minimal motion transfer.</p><p>Due to the lack of edge support, I wouldn’t recommend this mattress for a child or young kid who may toss and turn during the night since they might roll right off. This could be prevented with guardrails, but at the most basic level, it could be an issue.</p><h2 id=what-sets-puffy-royal-mattress-apart-from-other-mattresses>What sets Puffy Royal Mattress apart from other mattresses?</h2><p>I feel the Puffy Royal stands out from other mattresses with its 10-layer design, easy setup, and it’s designed specifically for all sleepers whether they sleep on their back, stomach, or side. Puffy is a bit more costly compared to other brands, but if you shop during a sale or when promotional codes are available, it could be more affordable and a better value.</p><h2 id=other-mattresses-from-puffy>Other mattresses from Puffy</h2><p>Aside from this hybrid mattress, Puffy has other mattresses available for purchase. The brand's other mattresses include the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Puffy Monarch</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Puffy Lux</a>, and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Puffy Cloud</a>. There’s also a selection of <a rel=nofollow href=#>smart beds</a> available to browse in the same versions.</p><h2 id=puffy-royal-mattress-frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Puffy Royal Mattress frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How soft is the Puffy Royal mattress?</h3><p>The Puffy Royal Mattress is soft to the touch without sacrificing support. I’d say it’s more on the firmer side than the softer side, but this is subjective based on individual preferences. There’s no need for a <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress topper</a> to make it softer since it’s already plush, however, I wouldn’t categorize it as cloud-like.</p><h3>Is Puffy Royal good for stomach sleepers?</h3><p>Yes, the Puffy Royal Mattress is good for stomach sleepers and all types of sleepers, for that matter. I’m a stomach sleeper and I didn’t have any problems with this mattress — no pain or discomfort.</p><h3>Does the Puffy Mattress sag?</h3><p>After a month of sleeping on this mattress, the Puffy mattress didn’t sag even in regions prone to sagging. The memory foam material bounced right back after pressure was relieved and there were no weird lumps and bumps left behind.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final verdict</h2><p>The mattress is comfortable, supportive, and cool to the touch making it a great choice for all types of sleepers. Whether you’re looking for a new mattress to replace your current one or an additional queen or <a rel=alternate href=#>king mattress</a> for a guest bedroom, the Puffy Royal is the way to go.</p><p><h3 class=title>Puffy Royal Hybrid Mattress - Queen</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8%2BunZ%2BxXae8uq3LZqSarKSnsrS%2FjKucr6GVrHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpuffy-royal-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpuffy-royal-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpuffy-royal-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpuffy-royal-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpuffy-royal-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpuffy-royal-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./saadiyat-cultural-district-abu-dhabi-on-track-for-2025-completion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./saadiyat-cultural-district-abu-dhabi-on-track-for-2025-completion.html>Saadiyat Cultural District Abu Dhabi: On track for 2025 completion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1452132-organs-missing-41-year-old-man-dies-anambra-hotel.html>Organs Missing as 41-Year-Old Man Dies in Anambra Hotel, Family Demands Justice</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1452132-organs-missing-41-year-old-man-dies-anambra-hotel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
