To grab her attention, beauty brands tailored their marketing towards women only. All the women in their adverts weer women and their product names were always gendered and their slogans were geared towards empowering that woman through her looks.It used gendered slogans. They targeted women and women alone and for the moment, that was good enough for them.</p><p>Up until a year of so ago, that was the status quo but now, as the world becomes more inclusive and the mainstream idea of gender becomes more fluid, makeup and beauty brands are thinking more widely about their customer base. Brands like Cover Girl and Anastasia Beverly Hills have been releasing campaigns that feature men since 2016 and brands are waking up to the reality that makeup exists for everyone and does not have to be limited to one demographic.</p><p>According to Teen Vogue:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Men have been wearing makeup for centuries, but in a beauty industry dominated by women, it's difficult to remember that storied legacy. There is a burgeoning movement though of male Youtube and Instagram stars who are putting their stamp on the beauty industry in a major way for Generation Z and millennials.</p><p>In an interview with Glamour Magazine, Jessica Blackler, MUA and founder of gender neutral makeup brand Jecca Makeup said, “For a long time, gender fluid beauty has been underrepresented by mainstream companies, however, outdated perceptions of beauty are finally shifting. Consumers are becoming more open minded and socially conscious which in turn means that brands are looking at this consumer demand and expanding into a whole new and untapped market.</p><p>I began working with the LGBT community a couple of years ago, way before the whole gender boom and there was practically nothing that catered for them – they were totally overlooked which is why I created my own brand, so it’s really interesting and refreshing to see how this is now becoming more mainstream.”</p><p>During this time, we have also noticed the rise of the male beauty influencer. Young men who are exploring their love of makeup and beauty in front of the lens and making a career from it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>1.

My mother was a showgirl who was often gone performing. I always watched her while she got ready. I also took inspiration from Beyoncé and her simple approach to beauty. And, to balance it all out, I found even more interest in makeup one night when I was sneaking to watch RuPaul's Drag Race. I admired the queens on the show and their skills with makeup artistry so somewhere in between my mother getting ready for her shows, admiring Beyoncé, sneaking to watch RuPaul's Drag Race... I started to play with makeup and the passion grew from there.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>2.

He began his Youtube channel in 2014 and his content consists of make-up tutorials, make-up first impressions, and beauty tips.</p><p>In an interview with Glamour magazine, Manny revealed, ''I'm a member of the LGBTQ community, and I feel like we need more representation. In the make-up world, especially, it has always been really, really hard for men in beauty to kind of be seen in a way beyond being a "fad. I think that's a big thing we're headed toward now. [Men in make-up] is much more normalized now.''</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-28>4.

Soon afterwards, his contract with Cover Girl came and catapulted James to star status, making him one of the most popular young beauty vloggers in the industry.</p><p>Speaking to the New York Times about being chosen as the first Cover Boy James said, "As more and more guys come to light, the way the internet is, there will be people who don't agree. Those negative comments probably make people not want to do it, because lots of people take that stuff very seriously. The fact that I am the first boy is so cool. It shows that this industry is actually becoming genderless, and we're really making the push toward equal opportunities for everybody, regardless of race, sexuality, gender."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-34>5.
