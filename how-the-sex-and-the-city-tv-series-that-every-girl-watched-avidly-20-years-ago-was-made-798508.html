When the producers of&nbsp;the series decided to&nbsp;film the story, they bought the film rights for <a href=#>$60,000</a>. And though the movie used the book’s <a href=#>main</a> characters as&nbsp;the base, scriptwriters still came up&nbsp;with completely new stories for those characters.

There were negotiations about making a&nbsp;third movie, but Kim Cattrall refused to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;it, blaming it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the fact she had outgrown the role of&nbsp;Samantha, both morally and by&nbsp;the nature of&nbsp;her age.
