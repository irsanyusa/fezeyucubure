Is anyone in jail? Is anyone pregnant? Which kitchen maid likes which footman? Which bit of British old-timey law minutiae were we supposed to remember?</p><p>Get ready for the Jan. 5 season premiere with our quick character-by-character guide to what happened last season. (And check in here Sunday night for our recap of the new season’s first episode.)</p><p><strong>Lots of spoilers for last year below, because that is the point.</strong><br>What year is it?&nbsp;Last we checked, it was 1921.</p><p>What’s up with the Crawley family?<br><strong>Matthew and Lady Mary Crawley: </strong>First, they finally got married. Matthew inherited money from the family of his late fiancée, Lavinia, but felt guilty keeping it—until he learned that Lavinia’s dad knew their wedding wasn’t going to work out before he wrote that will, and that the money could save Downton’s future (see below). After both of them worried that they might be infertile, they finally conceived. Then, in a season-finale tragedy, Matthew was killed by a car accident right after Mary gave birth. Crazy!</p><p><strong>Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham, and Cora, Countess of Grantham:</strong>&nbsp;Cora’s mom, played by <a href=#>Shirley MacLaine</a>, visited early in the season.&nbsp;Robert lost a lot of money, putting the estate in jeopardy until Matthew invested in it. Sharing ownership with Matthew, however, proved tricky, with Robert devoted to the old ways of doing things and Matthew encouraging them to change to save money. By the end of the season, he was finally grateful to have Matthew’s good influence.</p><p><strong>The late Lady Sybil Branson, née Crawley, and Tom Branson: </strong>Sybil was pregnant when she and and Tom came back from Ireland to attend Mary and Matthew’s wedding. They returned to Ireland, but not for long, as Tom’s political leanings forced them to leave the country. They would have the baby at Downton—but, in the first major shocker of the season, Sybil died in <a href=#>childbirth</a>. Tom and the baby, named Sybil after her mother and called Sybie, decided to stay at Downton, with Tom working as the estate agent. Later in the season, Tom almost got seduced by a rogue maid, Edna, but Edna got fired before they could do more than kiss.</p><p><strong>Lady Edith Crawley:&nbsp;</strong>Edith got engaged to an older gentleman, but he left her at the altar for her own good. Having given up on romance, she decided to try to have some sort of life, so she wrote a letter to the&nbsp;Times supporting suffrage and ended up getting a columnist gig, writing about modern women for&nbsp;The Sketch. That job introduced her to an editor, Michael Gregson, with whom she hit it off—before learning that Gregson was married. His wife is in an insane asylum, but that’s not grounds for divorce in England, so he’s stuck.</p><p><strong>Violet, the Dowager Countess:&nbsp;</strong>Ever as before, ever just as awesome. She would likely not approve of this post. Or that blouse you’re wearing.</p><p><strong>Isobel Crawley:&nbsp;</strong>Matthew’s mom tried to put her do-gooding ways to work saving prostitutes from ruin and ended up helping an unwed mother who used to work at Downton, Ethel, despite potential shame it could bring on the family.</p><p><strong>Cousin Shrimpie, Susan and Rose MacClare:&nbsp;</strong>Susan sends her upstart daughter Rose to Downton for some adult supervision. Rose likes jazz and dancing and drinking and is younger than the Crawley daughters. Then, at the end of the season, the Crawleys went to visit their cousins at their home in Scotland, at which point it was revealed that Shrimpie and Susan were being posted to India, so Rose is going to stay with the Crawleys at Downton.</p><p>(<strong>MORE</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Americans Almost Missed Out on��Downton Abbey</a>)</p><p>What about their staff?<br><strong>Carson, the butler:&nbsp;</strong>Dealt with an understaffed house.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Hughes, the housekeeper:&nbsp;</strong>Had a health scare, but it was fine.</p><p><b>John Bates, valet to Lord Grantham, and Anna Bates, maid to Lady Mary:&nbsp;</b>Bates started off in jail for murdering his wife, but Anna found his late wife’s diary, which led her to a clue that indicates it was a suicide, not a murder, and Bates was framed. Jail was extra tricky for Bates, thanks to a no-good cellmate, so it’s extra good news when he walks free.</p><p><strong>Mrs. O’Brien, maid to Lady Grantham:&nbsp;</strong>Continued to be pretty much rotten, but a reminder of the fact that she caused Cora’s miscarriage in season 1 set her back in line. Expressed jealousy of Susan’s maid, who gets to go to India with the MacClares.</p><p><strong>Mr. Molesley, valet to Matthew Crawley:</strong> Continued to be awkward and sort of pathetic.</p><p><strong>Thomas Barrow, under-butler:&nbsp;</strong>He really thought that Jimmy, the footman, loved him back, and he tried to put the moves on the younger man, which majorly backfired and resulted in him almost getting arrested. Lord Grantham steps in and saves him by rehiring him in the position of under-butler.</p><p><strong>Daisy, kitchen maid:&nbsp;</strong>Got a little more self-confidence, but not much.</p><p><strong>Alfred, footman:&nbsp;</strong>He’s tall, he’s O’Brien’s nephew, he’s serious and he has a crush on Ivy.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Patmore, cook:&nbsp;</strong>Was suddenly super wise, but not about electrical appliances.</p><p><strong>Jimmy, first footman:&nbsp;</strong>He’s handsome and all the kitchen maids liked him—and so did Thomas. He gets promoted to first footman to ensure he doesn’t talk about Thomas putting the moves on him. He’s maybe a cad and maybe just likes to have fun.</p><p><strong>Ivy, kitchen maid:&nbsp;</strong>Alfred and Jimmy competed for her attention, which made Daisy not like her, but eventually Daisy came around.</p><p>And anyone else?<br><strong>Dr. Clarkson:&nbsp;</strong>He was vindicated in his medical opinion about Sybil, even though it was too late to save her, and later tried and failed to make something happen with Isobel.</p><p><strong>Mr. Murray, the lawyer:</strong> Continued to look like a walrus and reprimand Robert for his bad business decisions.</p><p>Anything else?<br><strong>Catch up in more detail:</strong> with&nbsp;<a href=#>TIME’s recaps of&nbsp;Downton Abbey‘s Third Season</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pe7W1zJ5lnKedZH9xfZNoZ2pnYGh8pbHPrWSonl2bv6qxzZ2jsmWimrqqusOeqaxlp52utXnHmqepnZ6asW67zWabqK%2BeqbyvecCbmZ6xXaGutMCMspyaql8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdept-of-friendly-reminders-what-happened-on-downton-abbey-last-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdept-of-friendly-reminders-what-happened-on-downton-abbey-last-year.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdept-of-friendly-reminders-what-happened-on-downton-abbey-last-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdept-of-friendly-reminders-what-happened-on-downton-abbey-last-year.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdept-of-friendly-reminders-what-happened-on-downton-abbey-last-year.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdept-of-friendly-reminders-what-happened-on-downton-abbey-last-year.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./collateral-beauty-review-will-smith-1201940154.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./collateral-beauty-review-will-smith-1201940154.html>Film Review: Collateral Beauty</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./comics-10-hilarious-illustrations-about-menstrual-periods.html>10 hilarious illustrations about menstrual periods</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./comics-10-hilarious-illustrations-about-menstrual-periods.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
