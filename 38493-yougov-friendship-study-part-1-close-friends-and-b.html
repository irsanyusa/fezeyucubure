Four in ten Britons (42%) describe themselves as extroverts.</p><p>Young British women are most likely to describe themselves as extroverts – 45-49% of women between 16-39 say they are fairly or very extroverted, compared to 35-39% of men in the same age groups. Overall, more British men than women (53% vs 48%) describe themselves as introverts.</p><h3>How many friends overall do people have?</h3><p>Six in ten (58%) Britons say they have ten or fewer friends. A further 23% say they have between 11 and 25 friends and 6% say they have between 26 and 50 friends. Just 3% say they have over 50 friends.</p><h3>How many close friends do people have?</h3><p>One in eight (12%) Britons have just one person whom they consider to be a close friend. Four in ten (41%) Britons say they have two or three close friends, a further fifth (21%) have four or five, while 16% have more than six.</p><p>Seven percent of Britons say they do not have anyone who they could call a close friend, with this applying to both genders equally. The older people get, the more likely they are to say they don’t have a close friend: from 2% among 16-24-year-olds to 9% of Britons who are 40 or older.</p><p>Introverted Britons are more likely than extroverted Britons to have fewer good friends – 61% of those who describe themselves as introverted have up to 3 close friends, compared to 46% of those who describes themselves as extroverted. One in ten (10%) introverts say they don’t have any close friends, with this applying to just 3% of the extroverts.</p><h3>Why do some Brits not have a close friend?</h3><p>The 7% of Britons who say they have no close friends are split as to why - half say they have friends but none they consider close, while a quarter say they struggle to make close friends, and a further quarter say they fell out or lost touch with people with whom they used to be close.</p><p>Additionally, 16% say not having close friends is their choice, while one in nine (11%) say that their close friend(s) died.</p><h3>Where did Britons meet their current close friends?</h3><p>Work (44%) and school (41%) are the most popular origin points for Britons’ close friendships.</p><p>A quarter (27%) got to know their closest friends through other people, one in five (19%) met them in their neighbourhood and 16% met them through family. Six percent say they met their current closest friends through the internet.</p><p>Women are slightly likelier than men to have met their current closest friends through family (18% vs 14%) or work (46% vs 41%).</p><p>Older Britons are more likely than younger Britons to have met their closest friends through family - 22% of those over 60 made friends through family, compared to 12-14% of younger age groups. Younger generations are also less likely to have met close friends in their local area: just 5% among 16-24-year-olds, compared to 34% of those 60 or older.</p><h3>Do Britons have someone, excluding family or a partner, whom they would call their 'best friend'?</h3><p>Six in ten (63%) Britons say they have a ‘best friend’, but 19% are not confident that the best friend status is reciprocated, and 3% say they know the person they view as their best friend does not see them in the same way</p><p>Three in ten (28%) Britons say they do not have a ‘best friend’, with this being the case more for men (31%) than women (26%).</p><p>Among 16-24 year olds, 21% of men and 19% of women say they don’t have a best friend.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhraGmGdHnYqKygp6Zis7O1xKebrKCZpXq0wNSdsGaokafBbn2MnKOoq5Vis7O1xKebrGWRo7Furg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f38493-yougov-friendship-study-part-1-close-friends-and-b.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f38493-yougov-friendship-study-part-1-close-friends-and-b.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f38493-yougov-friendship-study-part-1-close-friends-and-b.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f38493-yougov-friendship-study-part-1-close-friends-and-b.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f38493-yougov-friendship-study-part-1-close-friends-and-b.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f38493-yougov-friendship-study-part-1-close-friends-and-b.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./survivor-contestant-removed-cbs-sexual-harassment.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./survivor-contestant-removed-cbs-sexual-harassment.html>&amp;quot;Survivor&amp;quot; Cuts Contestant Over Harassment: What Happens Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./theres-no-business-like-the-arms-business-part-2.html>There's No Business Like the Arms Business, Part 2</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./theres-no-business-like-the-arms-business-part-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
