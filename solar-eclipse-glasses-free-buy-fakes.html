I saw that [my brother’s ranch] was going to be in the middle of totality and I called him and said, ‘I hope you really are enjoying your ranch, because you got to keep it until then.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But where you purchase your glasses before next week's eclipse is important. Unsafe eclipse glasses were a significant problem in 2017, causing online retailers like Amazon to <a href=#>issue refunds</a> and face a <a href=#>lawsuit</a> by customers who purchased unsafe glasses.<strong> </strong>(The case was later dismissed in court.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s everything you need to know about how to purchase solar eclipse glasses, get them for free—and avoid fakes.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How to purchase safe solar eclipse glasses</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before purchasing solar eclipse glasses or viewers, be sure to check that the items are coming from the<strong> </strong>American Astronomical Society’s (AAS) list of <a href=#>trusted vendors</a>. While the AAS previously issued a <a href=#>press release</a> stating that most eclipse glasses are safe to use, the group recently discovered a pair of counterfeit glasses that did not meet the ISO 12312-2 standards that dictate how much ultraviolet and infrared light can be transmitted by the filters.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It's not smart to just go on Amazon, Etsy, eBay, or Google and search for eclipse glasses and buy whatever pops up,” says Richard Fienberg, project manager of the American Astronomical Society's Solar Eclipse Task Force. “There are companies selling eclipse glasses under false pretenses. The two most likely false pretenses are the glasses have not actually been tested properly and shown to be safe, or the glasses are made in China but printed with information that says they're made in America.” Where the glasses are manufactured matters because glasses must be tested by special equipment in an accredited lab.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>‘20 or 30 Super Bowls.’ Drivers and Officials Brace for Massive Eclipse Traffic Jams</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a part of the Solar Eclipse Task Force, Fienberg looks at companies’ test reports, and verifies their distributor, along with conducting<strong> </strong>a series of other checks, before adding them to the AAS list. (The list is not exhaustive, meaning there could be other sellers that are safe to purchase from.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If you see a company that claims to be on the AAS list, and then you go look at the AAS list and they're not on it, that should tell you something,” says Feinberg. “They might have been on it in 2017. But we erased the list and started from scratch a few years ago.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Amazon tells TIME that all solar eclipse glasses they sell must be ISO compliant and come from the AAS list. “We continuously monitor our store, and if we discover a product was undetected by our automated checks, we address the issue immediately and refine our controls. We take action to maintain a safe selection for our customers, including removing noncompliant products, and outreach to sellers, manufacturers, and government agencies for additional information, when appropriate,” says an Amazon spokesperson.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How to test for faulty eclipse glasses</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Given the unreliable market, Fienberg suggests customers test out their eclipse glasses before April 8 to ensure they have a safe pair. To do so, he says you should first wear their eclipse glasses inside your home. If you can see the room and objects around you, that means your glasses are not dark enough and will not adequately<strong> </strong>protect you from the sun.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>These Are All the Different Types of Eclipses</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There's a few really really bright lights that you might be able to see through—like an old incandescent bulb, you might be able to see the filament, [or] if you have a halogen bulb,” Fienberg says. “If you do look through them and you can't see anything, then you can actually go outside and take a really quick glance at the sun through them and probably find that the view is okay, it's sharp, it's not too bright, not too dim. Then you should feel pretty, pretty confident that they're safe.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How to get free eclipse glasses</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The STAR Library Network is distributing five million eclipse glasses to more than 13,000 U.S. public libraries, according to the AAS. Interested patrons should check with their local library to see if they received any free pairs, and may also check <a href=#>possible locations with this map</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some optometry offices, including MyEyeDr., are giving out free eclipse glasses at <a href=#>select locations</a>. Warby Parker will also be offering <a href=#>free pairs</a> in all stores starting April 1.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>Where You Can Watch the Solar Eclipse</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Tuesday that the state will distribute free, limited edition “I love NY” eclipse<strong> </strong>glasses across 30 locations. You can check distribution centers <a href=#>here</a>. You should also check if your local county or city is offering free glasses. Residents in Chautauqua County, New York for instance, can get glasses from a <a href=#>number of locations</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You might also<strong> </strong>be able to snag some at your local watch party. The Republic Square in Austin, Texas is giving out free solar eclipse viewers for the <a href=#>first 200 guests</a> that attend.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>When do you need to use eclipse glasses?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While you’ll be able to <a href=#>see the eclipse</a> with your bare eyes once the moon completely covers the sun, or reaches totality, you must use solar eclipse glasses or viewers during the partial phases of the eclipse. That means that for the approximate hour leading up to—and the approximate hour after—the eclipse, your eyes need some sort of protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fienberg says that those outside the <a href=#>path of totality</a>—the roughly 115-mile wide path from which<strong> </strong>the total solar eclipse will be visible across 14 states—will have to use protection throughout the entire event.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>The Eclipse Could Bring $1.5 Billion Into States on the Path of Totality</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fienberg says that people can use solar eclipse glasses with their contact lenses or prescription glasses, but should not use any other objects to look more closely at the sun. “It is dangerous to put on a pair of solar eclipse glasses and then pick up a pair of binoculars and look through those,” he says. “If you do that, the extra light gathering power of those big front lenses on your binoculars is going to collect so much light that it's going to burn through the solar filter and through your eye.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Can you use old eclipse glasses?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you have eclipse glasses from previous solar eclipses that crossed the U.S. in 2017 and 2023, they will still be safe to use in 2024<strong>,</strong> Fienberg says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, the AAS advises folks to inspect their old lenses for any holes, tears, scratches, or other damage. Older solar eclipse glasses can only be used if they are in good condition, the lenses have not gotten loose from the frames, or they do not show any other problems.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>Why These Passengers Are Flying up to 30 Hours to See Four Minutes of the Eclipse</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What if you don’t have solar eclipse glasses?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those who don’t have eclipse glasses can still have a fun viewing experience by using pinhole projection.
