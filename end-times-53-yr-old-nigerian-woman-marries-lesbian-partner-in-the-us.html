I was drenched with fear, for a moment. I forgot where I was. I ask you all to close your eyes, imagine what would have happened Saturday at our wedding if we were in Nigeria.</p><p>Even though we went to great lengths to make sure we had security, the thought of the police barging in and arresting all our guests, my wife and I, to be carted off to jail, the women raped and beaten, the men brutalized, and my children beaten along with everyone else.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When I got my bearings, I got on my knees and thanked God for his grace of living in the US. Then I remembered all the people that could not do what we did with grace and class.</p><p>To all of you (gay) all over Africa, #westandforyou. May all our days be filled with blessings and grace.”</p><p>In another post on Facebook, Solar-Percy hinted that one of her children actually did her make-up and hair.</p><p>“My make-up was all I wanted that day. My weave looked like it grew out of my scalp. To have my first child do my hair and make-up, then walk me down the aisle was one of the best memories of the evening.”</p><p>The wedding which was well attended by other Nigerian gays in the US, also saw Solar-Percy and her bride decked up in both traditional attires, while another picture she posted showed her wearing a white wedding gown and being attended to by her first child.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Moji Solar-Percy says she has always been gay</strong></p><p><strong>Photo Credit: Facebook</strong></p><p>It was gathered that to satisfy her family back home, Solar-Percy had gotten married and had children for her husband but once she got to the United State, she could no longer hide her sexual orientation as a lesbian and promptly divorced her husband and got into several gay relationships before finding her wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02icp5xdqbausdJmbGxlqad6sLjDZqWin5WntqK6jLCmppmeYrqivtGinKxlnJrAo7XAp2SpmaKpu6a%2BjKKlZqyYmnq2v46gm2uflqiD</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fend-times-53-yr-old-nigerian-woman-marries-lesbian-partner-in-the-us.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fend-times-53-yr-old-nigerian-woman-marries-lesbian-partner-in-the-us.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fend-times-53-yr-old-nigerian-woman-marries-lesbian-partner-in-the-us.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fend-times-53-yr-old-nigerian-woman-marries-lesbian-partner-in-the-us.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fend-times-53-yr-old-nigerian-woman-marries-lesbian-partner-in-the-us.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fend-times-53-yr-old-nigerian-woman-marries-lesbian-partner-in-the-us.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./49841-as-the-general-election-approaches-public-attitudes-on-the-cost-of-living-remain-very-negative.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./49841-as-the-general-election-approaches-public-attitudes-on-the-cost-of-living-remain-very-negative.html>As the general election approaches, public attitudes on the cost of living remain very negative</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./forum-du-logement-social.html>12-2018 | Forum du logement Social</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./forum-du-logement-social.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
