Over-the-counter eyelash serums are considered cosmetics rather than medications, so they may contain ingredients not approved by the FDA. Check with your eye doctor for the best information.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-lash-growth-serums>Our top picks for the best lash growth serums</h2><p>While you might know where to go for the best eyeshadow palettes or the best eye creams, lash serums have a niche following. Some need to lengthen their lashes, some are looking for thicker lashes, and others are looking for medical or cosmetic ways to regrow eyelashes. To help you choose the best eyelash growth serum for you, we listed the top 15 serums in specific categories. Take note of the price and size of the product—packaging varies significantly by brand. The following list includes the best lash serums to help your eyelashes look stronger, longer, fuller, and more lustrous.</p><h3>Best lengthening lash growth serum: <a rel=nofollow href=#>RevitaLash Cosmetics Advanced Eyelash Conditioner</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lengthening lash growth serum</span></p><p><h3 class=title>RevitaLash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner Growth Serum, 2mL</h3></p><p>The RevitaLash conditioner is a bit of an investment, but online reviews say it’s worth it. Reports of lashes seeming twice as long immediately are all over Sephora, Ulta, and Bloomingdale’s websites. Many said they saw results in four weeks, which is markedly quicker than others on this list. One online reviewer stated, “This really works.

So why wouldn’t they be great at eyelashes, too? Olaplex's new eyelash serum uses bond-enhancing ingredients that help thicken and strengthen lashes. The serum vows to repair and strengthen the lash bond, reducing the risk of hair loss over time and leaving lashes thicker and softer.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Key ingredients: Peptides and bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate for strengthening</li><li>Size: .15 ounces</li><li>Application frequency: Twice daily</li><li>Price on publish: $50</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Strengthens lashes with bond-building peptides</li><li>Many online reviewers also stated their lashes ended up softer after months</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Must be applied twice daily for six months before seeing results</li></ul><h3>Best lash growth serum for thickening: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Velour Lashes Long & Strong Lash Serum</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lash growth serum for thickening</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2544468-main-zoom.jpg alt="Velour Lashes Long & Strong Lash Serum 0.14 oz, 4ml" title="Velour Lashes Long & Strong Lash Serum 0.14 oz, 4ml" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Velour Lashes Long & Strong Lash Serum 0.14 oz, 4ml</h3></p><p>Velour Lashes eyelash serum uses a combination of 10 amino acids to stimulate keratin production.

Latisse is the only FDA-approved eyelash serum for eyelash growth as of publication. It contains a prescription-strength prostaglandin analog that supports the development of existing eyelashes and stimulates new hair growth. Because it's so powerful, be sure to talk to your doctor about possible risks such as eye irritation, eye color changes, and eyelids darkening. If you wear contact lenses, you’ll need to remove them before application (and soft lenses may absorb the product). Consider switching to eyeglasses—our list of the best places to buy glasses online is a good starting point.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Key ingredients: Bimatoprost, only available by prescription</li><li>Size: 10 ounces</li><li>Application frequency: Once daily</li><li>Price on publish: $125</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The only serum on this list clinically proven to grow lashes</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Doctor’s visit is required</li><li>Some reported lid irritation or iris color change</li></ul><h3>Best drugstore lash growth serum: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Neutrogena Healthy Lash + Brow Enhancer Serum</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best drugstore lash growth serum</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Neutrogena Lash + Brow Enhancer Serum with Biotin & Peptides, 0.08 oz - 0.8 oz | CVS</h3></p><p>Looking to try a lash serum, but don’t want to make a huge investment?

Most packages provide detailed instructions on how to use (and how often to use) their specific lash serum, and what results generally look like. Most often, you apply the serum to the lash line with an included applicator, similar to applying liquid eyeliner. Others are applied by pumping a dose onto your fingers and dabbing it along your lashes. They often require daily use for peptides or collagen to affect your lash line. Many reviewers say eyelashes will appear longer, stronger or fuller, with results showing up for most between 2-6 months.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do eyelash growth serums really work?</h3><p>Thousands of beauty experts and online reviewers say they do, but it does take time. Most eyelash serums take two to six months to see an effect, and consistent application is important.</p><h3>Is eyelash serum safe for your eyes?</h3><p>Yes. While the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve over-the-counter eyelash serums, cosmetics companies do ample testing. Each product reacts with your chemistry differently. Stop using the product immediately if you notice any signs of discoloration or irritation. Sensitive skin or eyes? Check to see if your chosen product is dermatologist- or optometrist-approved.</p><h3>How do you apply eyelash serum?</h3><p>Apply eyelash serums to your lashes using the included applicator, just like you would apply liquid eyeliner. Pump-style applications allow you to deposit serum onto your finger and apply manually onto your lashes.</p><h3>How long will it take to see a difference in the length and volume of my eyelashes?</h3><p>Efficacy depends on product and each user’s genetics and beauty regimen, but with most eyelash serums on this list, users started to see results in four to eight weeks, with the best results after six months.</p><h3>Can you use lash growth serums with lash extensions?</h3><p>Yes, as long as they are not oil-based. Stay away from castor oil, sunflower seed oil, and other mineral oils, as they naturally break down the adhesive in lash extensions. You can continue to use non-oil-based lash growth serums at any time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnJbAqXnGq6awrJhiwKa%2B1KaqaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-lash-growth-serums.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-lash-growth-serums.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-lash-growth-serums.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-lash-growth-serums.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-lash-growth-serums.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-lash-growth-serums.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./blake-shelton-morgan-wallen-to-perform-on-new-years-eve-live-nashvilles-big-bash.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./blake-shelton-morgan-wallen-to-perform-on-new-years-eve-live-nashvilles-big-bash.html>Blake Shelton, Morgan Wallen to Perform on 'New Year's Eve Live: Nashville's Big Bash'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./idol-winner-maddie-poppe-writes-herself-a-fake-love-note-fans-dont-get-the-joke.html>'Idol' Winner Maddie Poppe Writes Herself a Fake Love Note, Fans Don't Get the Joke</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./idol-winner-maddie-poppe-writes-herself-a-fake-love-note-fans-dont-get-the-joke.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
